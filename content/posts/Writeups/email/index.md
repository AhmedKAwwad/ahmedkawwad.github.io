<br>
so let's dig in at all these links and see if there's any 
accounts with public email or we can get its email. 

GitHub Account seems sus for me  as it's recently created and also has only 1 repo called "
MyFirstRepository".

Checking this repo , i find it has 2 commits
<br><br>
<img class = "img" src="/files/repo.png" alt="repo-screen" width="900" height="230" >
<br><br>
A bit of more digging you can find that for commits there is a details can get more info by clickin on commit ID .

<br><br>
<img class = "img" src="/files/commit.png" alt="commits-screen" width="900" height="230" >
<br><br>

By clicking on it , changes done in this commit appears and also URL now including "commit ID" 
```
"https://github.com/c5oylchicrlnofu/MyFirstRepository/commit/9f15379fa7f92d37c6a5dda62ee9df73367709db"
```

### And here is the trick :
you can always git more details about the author's email of commit  by adding ".patch" after the URL of commit details as following:

```
"https://github.com/c5oylchicrlnofu/MyFirstRepository/commit/9f15379fa7f92d37c6a5dda62ee9df73367709db.patch"

```
And BOOM here we go:

```
